# Installing the vulnerable server
I tested this on an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS server.
In order to execute this, replace `<YOURIP!!!!!!>` in `setup.sh` with the actual ip of your server.
The script will install the vulnerable version of smtpd (6.6.1) set up the whole dependencies and perform the minimal configuration required to run smtpd.
After the script is executed, smtpd gets launched and the servise is available on `YourIp:25`.
